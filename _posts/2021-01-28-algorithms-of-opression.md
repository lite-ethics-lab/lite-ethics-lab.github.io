## Introduction : The Power of Algorithms
* Part of the challenge of understanding algorithmic oppression is to understand that mathematical formulations to drive automated decisions are made by human beings. while we often think of 'big data' and 'algorithms' as being benign, neutral, or objective, they are anything but.  - pg 1
* Of course, Google Search is an advertising company, not a reliable information company. - pg 5
* There is missing social and human context in some types of algorithmically driven decision making, and this matters for everyone engaging with these types of technologies in everyday life. - pg 10
* We have to ask what is lost, who is harmed, and what should be forgotten with the embrace of artificial intelligence in decision making. It is of no collective benefit to organize information resources on the web through processes that solidify inequality and marginalization. - pg 14
