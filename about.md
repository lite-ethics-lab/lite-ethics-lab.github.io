Hello! My name is Adam Jones, and I am one of the Assistant Lab Managers within the LITE Lab at Missouri S&T! I'm very excited to be apart of this research when it comes to the use, especially the public use, of AI. I enjoy studying anything hands on and technical, and how computers can at their core change everything we know in our daily lives. In my free time I like to play games, watch YouTube, and study classic cars!
