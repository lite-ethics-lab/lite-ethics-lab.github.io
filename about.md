Hello! My name is Adam Jones, and I am one of the Assistant Lab Managers within the LITE Lab at Missouri S&T! I'm very excited to be apart of this research when it comes to the use, especially the public use, of AI. I enjoy studying anything hands on and technical, and how computers can at their core change everything we know in our daily lives. In my free time I like to play games, watch YouTube, and study classic cars!

My name is Gabriella Miesner and I am one of the Lab Managers in the LITE Lab at Missouri S&T. I have a particular interest in social change, which has shaped my interest in the ethics of AI, especially the possibility of using AI to challenge oppressive systems. When you don't find me at the lab, you can find me coding and listening to an endless amount of podcasts.
