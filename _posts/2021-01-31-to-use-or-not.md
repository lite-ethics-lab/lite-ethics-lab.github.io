* ML thus constitutes a new programming paradigm: With ML, algorithms derive solutions from data, instead of having humans manually solving problems and translating their solutions into code anymore.

* The resulting handover of problem-solving activities to data-driven algorithms therefore requires us to reassess the role of IS in organizations and our knowledge on how to manage IS successfully.

* With ML-based AI essentially representing a technology for machine-driven problem solving that organizations increasingly adopt [9, 32, 43], this core assumption must be fundamentally questioned.

* Since ill-defined problems can contain characteristics that lead to unexpected or unsatisfactory results (e.g., selecting unsuitable approaches or missing relevant aspects), problem finding essentially affects the success of problem-solving activities.
